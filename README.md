PRoblem Definition:
In the bustling environment of a fast-food restaurant, the primary goal is to 
ensure optimal utilization of resources and time, thereby enhancing overall 
operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. However, a prevalent issue 
faced by many restaurant owners is the lack of efficient resource management. 
Often, schedules are created without meticulous consideration of time and 
resource allocation, resulting in ineffective service delivery to customers.
Mismanagement leads to various operational challenges, including insufficient 
staffing, which forces overworked employees to hastily attend to customers, 
potentially leading to service delays and dissatisfaction.Furthermore, effective 
inventory management is identified as a critical component for optimizing 
customer satisfaction, supplier capabilities, and production scheduling.

Inadequate control over inventory often results in shortages of essential raw 
materials, particularly during peak hours, compromising the restaurant's ability to 
promptly fulfill customer orders.[3]
To address these pressing challenges, this project focuses on devising a 
comprehensive strategy for the efficient allocation of staff during regular and 
peak hours, as well as timely restocking of inventory. The objective is to 
determine the required resources and time for every operation, ranging from 
food preparation to the timely replenishment of ingredients. The development of 
this project is facilitated using the GPenSIM toolbox in MATLAB, enabling a 
systematic approach to optimizing resources and time management in the fastfood restaurant industry
